1. Build executable jar file
2. Build docker image (docker build -t bootdocker:1 .)
3. Check if the docker image was built successfully (docker images | grep bootdocker)
4. Run docker container using the image built (docker run -d --name bootdocker -p 8080:8080 bootdocker:1)
5. Check if the docker container was built successfully (docker ps -a | grep bootdocker)
6. Look at the log file to see if the application ran successfully (docker logs -f bootdocker)
